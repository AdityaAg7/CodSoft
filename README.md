  - Use the interface to add or remove tasks from the list.

## Task 2: Calculator
A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations.
- **Features**:
  - Allows users to input two numbers and select an operation (+, -, *, /).
  - Displays the result of the operation.
- **Technology**: Python, `tkinter` for GUI.
- **How to Run**:
  - Run the `calculator.py` file.
  - Enter the numbers and operation in the provided fields, and view the result.

## Task 3: Password Generator
A password generator that creates strong, random passwords.
- **Features**:
  - Allows users to specify the desired password length.
  - Generates a random password with letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Technology**: Python, `tkinter` for GUI.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CodSoft.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the directory**:
   ```bash
   cd CodSoft
   ```
3. **Run each task individually** by navigating to the file and running it using Python.

   ```bash
   python <task_file>.py
   ```

4. **Requirements**: 
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
